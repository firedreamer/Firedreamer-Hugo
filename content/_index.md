# For the ðŸ’– of Games.

Team Firedreamer is a close-knit collective of creatives, working together continents apart, to make fun, vibrant and spectacular games as an interactive medium to explore narratives, themes and ideologies, or just because a concept is cool!

We aim to lower the barrier for entry into the game industry by developing our own open source games, and believe that games are the coolest artistic medium known to humanity, that our players are part of the game just as much as we are as developers,	and that making games should not be an absolute mental, physical and emotional slog.

We're currently working on The Prelude, our first game in the Distributed Development series.
