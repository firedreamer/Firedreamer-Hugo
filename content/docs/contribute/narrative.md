### The Lore Base
While a fair amount of narrative discussion does take place over Discord, ideas that have been set in stone must be updated on the Firedreamer wiki. This also serves as a singular hub to draw inspiration from, and get a general idea of the who's whos and what's whats. The Lore base will be added to the wiki to faciliate this shortly.

### Tools
While the lore base covers the overarching story, since the Distributed Development project often uses a branching narrative structure, conversations need to be authored using an open source tool called [Talker Maker Deluxe, which can be downloaded by clicking on this link.](https://github.com/digiwombat/TalkerMakerDeluxe/releases) It uses an easy to understand, intuitive user interface that allows us to easily visualise branching dialogue.
