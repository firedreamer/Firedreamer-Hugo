Audio is primarily handled on a case-by-case basis, however, broadly, there are four primary types of audio assets to be used in the Distributed Development projects.

### Ambient
Ambient audio is to be designed such that most of it must come from sources within the game world. This means that the hum of HVAC systems must come from their specific vents, or the rustle of tree leaves must come from individual trees(This does mean that ambience and foley have to work closely together). There are, however, cases where audio is "global", e.g. general wind blowing, raindrops, etc.
"Global" ambient audio can be recorded in stereo, but must be exported in the ogg VORBIS format.

### Foley and UI
All foley clips must be short, ogg VORBIS mono clips.

### Score
ogg VORBIS stereo clips, unless required to be mono in case of diegetic audio sources. Depending on the need, the stems may or may not need to be separately exported, in case some situations call for a dynamically changing soundtrack.

### Sound Design
The Distributed Development project pays extra attention to sound design. Specific details will be provided on a case-by-case basis for the mood and theme of environments where the sounds play.
