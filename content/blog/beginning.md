title: Restructuring Firedreamer, A New Beginning

Hello all! It's been too long but it's time for an update on the state of Firedreamer and plans for the future. There have been a LOT of changes, so please read carefully.

---

## The Games
Essentially, Damage Done is no longer a single game, but rather, part of a series of FIVE games, now collectively known as the Distributed Development project. 
The first four establish key narrative and gameplay concepts, that slowly build up to the fifth, much longer game. This will streamline development and ensure that even if we don't reach our goals with the fifth game, the others will be solid games in their own right. If we do finish all five games and want to continue, we may branch out and create games not related to DD, or continue making games set within the universe, or both!

The Distributed Development project will cover a series of narratives within an alternate reality where nature, after having been polluted and destroyed for centuries, decides to strike back against humanity. Three mega-corporations are primarily involved in the narrative: IconoKlast Tech pushes the limits of science without thought to the state of the planet. Bicoastal Interventions, a private military contractor, protects their endeavors, secures their funding, and suppresses all those who would stand in their way. Orbis Media ensures that the masses are told only what the other two want them to hear, and keeps them distracted in every way possible. As the planet overheats and humanity is threatened with extinction, nature’s supernatural agents force humanity to wake up and rise against their oppressors, with many bands of rebels forming and joining together to take down the Big Three corporations controlling the world.

These five planned games will most likely be made with Unreal Engine 4.

## The Crew
Firedreamer will no longer be led by one person alone and hopefully never will be again. Instead, we will have a collective leadership team with three members:

 - [Fox (@foxofaces/fallfox)](https://twitter.com/foxofaces) will be the lead programmer and is in charge of most decisions about development tools, structural conventions, and other technical details.
 - [Sam (@NurruRai)](https://twitter.com/nurrurai) will be our social media manager and owner of the new Discord server, and will handle most public relations and financial decisions from now on.
 - [Kaz (@Kaunaz0)](https://twitter.com/kaunaz2) will be our lead designer and playtester and will be in charge of most gameplay and game design decisions.

We may add more members to the leadership team, and if we do, responsibilities and duties will be distributed as necessary to keep all of its members on relatively equal footing.

## Finances
Any and all revenue made from our games, along with all donations, investements and other financial assets received, will be placed into a treasury. The treasury is divided in the following manner:

- 40% of funds are reserved for Firedreamer's operational expenses, such as commissions, web hosting, servers, licensing fees, and the like.
- 40% of funds belong to the collective and may be used by any Firedreamer production team member. However, it must fund a tangible personal expense such as a bill or physical equipment. In good faith, we won't ask for a proof of purchase, but should we discover that our trust has been misplaced, we may change this clause.
- The remaining 20% of funds are stashed in a contingency deposit, to be used in case of emergencies.

## Going Forward
With these changes in mind, we would like everyone to consider their options. If you are seeing this message, you are invited to join Firedreamer proper and be a part of our production team. We'll accept whatever you have to offer - programming, animation, art, writing, music, voice acting, and whatever else. There is no set work schedule and you can contribute however much of your time and effort you feel is right for you to spare. You will have no obligation to stay with Firedreamer for any reason; no matter what you contribute or for how long, you will be credited for the games you work on.

As far as timelines for development go, we don’t have any - at least no rigid ones, considering the flexibility of the project. Right now, we are attempting to make time in our lives for Firedreamer, so actual development will have a rather slow start. Our current plan is to write out the storylines and plan the game mechanics of the five Damage Done games before we begin actual programming, which will give us extra time to set personal schedules for ourselves. In other words, things will get done when they get done. This also means there is very little commitment at the moment, so don’t feel like you’re being pressured into joining.

If you don't feel like actually working on the games but would like to contribute in some other way, we can offer you a spot in our community representatives. We'll listen to your ideas and feedback on the games, and you'll be given priority for playtesting. If you're not interested in that but still want to tag along for the ride, that's okay! Just make sure you're in the Camp Firedreamer Discord server to get notified immediately for development updates, teasers, trailers, and releases, and to interact with other members of the community in a safe, accepting space. Eventually, we’ll also be opening up moderator applications for trusted members of the community, so stick around if you’d be interested in that.

We look forward to having you!
