Hello all! We have hit a milestone!

The technical side of pre-production for The Prelude has now completed. I have created a collaboration guide which includes the technical details for how you can contribute to the development of...

# What's this? The Distributed Development Project?

The DD acronym has stayed with us right since the idea of Damage Done, the game, was conceived way back in 2017. Since then, the project has evolved, diversified and kinda grown into its own big thing. In order to better describe the way DD is, I have opted to rename it to the Distributed Development project. The name of the fifth large entry? Who knows, that's a bridge we'll cross when we get to it.

As mentioned earlier, I have started working on the Wiki for DD, which will serve as a central repository for all our work stuffs, lore, character descriptions, that sort of thing, as well as a comprehensive guide for the general expectations for the deliverables when talking about assets. Eventually, more features like a project tracker may be added to the Wiki, but for now, this was the single most important thing that needed to go out as promised, so here goes!

As always, thanks for sticking with us.  
Cheers,
